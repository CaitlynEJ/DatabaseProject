# DatabaseProject
A semester long project for my Introduction to Databases class. With my class partner, we created a simple website and database to communicate and hold infomration about a fictional school based on the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the Marvel Comic Universe. 

At this time, the webiste and database are unhosted. I have included our project report that includes our peer reviews, edits, ERD, Schema, and screenshots of the site. We decided to use a Bootstrap framework to easily design our forms for a clean look.
